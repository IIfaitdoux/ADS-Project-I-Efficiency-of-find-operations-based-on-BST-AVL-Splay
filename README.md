# ADS Project I:Efficiency of find operations based on BST,AVL and Splay
This is our first project of ADS. Sincerely I wish us have a perfect cooperation during the whole semester.

## Division of labor

- Zhiyu Lin: **Build the skeleton** of the program, including the definitions of data structures, basic operations of each structure and the file structure of the whole program.
- Junyu Hu: Complete the main.c file for testing, prepare the test data (some copied from pta some generated by another program) **collect the test results** and organize them into charts and graphs.
- Zhenhua Huang: Check all the previous work, analyze the test results and **write the report**.

## Structure of the program

- main.c: the main program for testing
- avl.c: operation functions of AVL trees
- bst.c: operation functions of BST
- splay.c: operation functions of splay trees
- tree.c: unify the insert & delete operation
- testmode.c: unify different testmodes
- result.csv: store the runtime data
- table.py: create the runtime table in different testmodes
- plot.py: plot the runtime data in different testmodes
- Makefile: build the program

## Some reminds

- Please add the make tool(usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Dev-Cpp\MinGW64\bin) into your environment variables
- If you see too many warnings when you “make”, just delete the ‘-Wall -g’ in the first line of makefile
- All members should edit this readme.md if there is a big change.
- Install pandas & matplotlib in your python env
